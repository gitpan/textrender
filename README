textrender - Turn stdin into rendered text graphics.

DESCRIPTION
    This allows you to make very nice renders of text for web reasons,
    without using photoshop/firewors, etc. The advantage is that since it's
    via the cli, you can save text and parameters to a file and use that as
    configuration!

    See textrender, the parent package.

USAGE
    textrender [OPTION]..

       -p number       pointsize, default 11
       -f hex          color, such as ddffee
       -b hex          background color, such as ddffee
       -n string       font name or path
       -o path         out filename
       -g string       gravity, default is west
       -d              debug, show the commands
       -s              drop shadow, off by default
       -S [1-100]      shadow opacity, default is 80 (sets -s to on)

    If no out filename path is provided, a temporary file is chosen- such as
    /tmp/textrender.2323525252.png and this path is printed to stdout.

    If you provide a path argument, this is not printed to stdout.

  USAGE EXAMPLES
       echo 'Leo Charre' | textrender -o /tmp/leocharre.png

       textrender ./file-with.text
